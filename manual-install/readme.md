# Manual installation

You can run the containers that are build for AIO with docker-compose. This comes with a few downsides, that are discussed below.

### Advantages
- You can run it without a container having access to the docker socket
- You can modify all values on your own

### Disadvantages
- You lose the AIO interface
- You lose update notifications and automatic updates
- You lose all AIO backup and restore features
- You need to know what you are doing, especially when modifying the docker-compose file
- Probably more

## How to use this?
First, install docker and docker-compose if not already done. Then simply run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minimailboxes/all-in-one.git
cd all-in-one/manual-install
```
Then copy the sample.conf to a new file, e.g. `cp sample.conf my.conf`, open the new conf file, e.g. with `nano my.conf`, edit all values that are marked with `# TODO!`, close and save the file.

Now copy the provided yaml file to a docker-compose file by running on x64 `cp latest.yml docker-compose.yml` and on arm64 `cp latest-arm64.yml docker-compose.yml`.

Now you should be ready to go with `sudo docker-compose --env-file my.conf up`.

## How to update?
Since the AIO containers may change in the future, it is highly recommended to strictly follow the following procedure whenever you want to upgrade your containers.
1. Run `sudo docker-compose --env-file my.conf down` to stop all running containers
1. Back up all important files and folders
1. Run `git pull` in order to get the updated yaml files from the repository. Now bring your `docker-compose.yml` file up-to-date with the updated one from the repository. You can use `diff docker-compose.yml latest.yml` on x64 and `diff docker-compose.yml latest-arm64.yml` on arm64 for comparing.
1. Also have a look at the `sample.conf` if any variable was added or renamed and add that to your conf file as well. Here may help the diff command as well.
1. After the file update was successful, simply run `sudo docker-compose --env-file my.conf pull` to pull the new images.
1. At the end run `sudo docker-compose --env-file my.conf up` in order to start and update the containers with the new configuration.

## FAQ
### Backup and restore?
If you leave `MINIMAILBOXES_DATADIR` in your conf file at the default value of `minimailboxes_aio_minimailboxes_data` and don't modify the yaml file, all data will be stored inside docker volumes which are on Linux by default located here: `/var/lib/docker/volumes`. Simply backing up this location should be a valid backup solution. Then you can also easily restore in case something bad happens. However if you change `MINIMAILBOXES_DATADIR` to a path like `/mnt/ncdata`, you obviously need to back up this location, too because the MiniMailboxes data will be stored there. The same applies to any change to the yaml file. 

Obviously you also need to back up the conf file and the yaml file if you modified it.
